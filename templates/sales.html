And these sales teams are often determined based on the region they're selling to, the product or service they're selling, and the target customer. Companies staff entire departments with employees dedicated to selling their products and services. Salespeople reach out to contacts that might be interested in purchasing the product or service that their company is selling â€” prospects that demonstrate interest through actions like visiting the company website or interacting with the company on social media.</p>
